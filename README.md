# XLE to CSV

This is a tiny app built as an excuse to explore Svelte and SvelteKit. It allows users to upload a .xle file generated by a [Solinst Levelogger](https://www.solinst.com/products/dataloggers-and-telemetry/3001-levelogger-series/levelogger/) and download a .csv file of the relevant log data it contains.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
